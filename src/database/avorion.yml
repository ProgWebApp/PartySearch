summary: Avorion is a procedurally generated sci-fi sandbox where players start out
  at the edge of the galaxy and must find their way to its core. Players build their
  own ships, which they will use to explore the galaxy, trade and fight. Space ships
  are mainly of large scale, with crews, turrets and energy systems that you will
  have to manage. The galaxy gets more hostile, but also more rewarding the closer
  players get to its core. You're free to play however you want, as a mercenary, freighter
  captain, admiral, scavenger or pirate, it's all up to you.
