summary: "Dying Light is a first-person, action survival horror game set in a vast\
  \ and dangerous open world. During the day, players traverse an expansive urban\
  \ environment overrun by a vicious outbreak, scavenging the world for supplies and\
  \ crafting weapons to defend against the growing infected population. At night,\
  \ the hunter becomes the hunted, as the infected become aggressive and more dangerous.\
  \ Most frightening are the predators which only appear after sundown. Players must\
  \ use everything in their power to survive until the morning\u2019s first light."
