summary: "It's a lovely morning in the village and you are a horrible goose.\n\nUntitled\
  \ Goose Game is a slapstick-stealth-sandbox, where you are a goose let loose on\
  \ an unsuspecting village. Make your way around town, from peoples' back gardens\
  \ to the high street shops to the village green, setting up pranks, stealing hats,\
  \ honking a lot, and generally ruining everyone\u2019s day."
