summary: Minecraft focuses on allowing the player to explore, interact with, and modify
  a dynamically-generated map made of one-cubic-meter-sized blocks. In addition to
  blocks, the environment features plants, mobs, and items. Some activities in the
  game include mining for ore, fighting hostile mobs, and crafting new blocks and
  tools by gathering various resources found in the game. The game's open-ended model
  allows players to create structures, creations, and artwork on various multiplayer
  servers or their single-player maps. Other features include redstone circuits for
  logic computations and remote actions, minecarts and tracks, and a mysterious underworld
  called the Nether. A designated but completely optional goal of the game is to travel
  to a dimension called the End, and defeat the ender dragon.
