summary: 'Dig, Fight, Explore, Build: The very world is at your fingertips as you
  fight for survival, fortune, and glory. Will you delve deep into cavernous expanses
  in search of treasure and raw materials with which to craft ever-evolving gear,
  machinery, and aesthetics? Perhaps you will choose instead to seek out ever-greater
  foes to test your mettle in combat? Maybe you will decide to construct your own
  city to house the host of mysterious allies you may encounter along your travels?
  In the World of Terraria, the choice is yours!'
