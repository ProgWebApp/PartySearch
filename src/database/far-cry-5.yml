summary: "Welcome to Hope County, Montana, land of the free and the brave, but also\
  \ home to a fanatical doomsday cult known as The Project at Eden\u2019s Gate that\
  \ is threatening the community's freedom. Stand up to the cult\u2019s leader, Joseph\
  \ Seed and the Heralds, and spark the fires of resistance that will liberate the\
  \ besieged community.\n\nIn this expansive world, your limits and creativity will\
  \ be tested against the biggest and most ruthless baddest enemy Far Cry has ever\
  \ seen. It\u2019ll be wild and it\u2019ll get weird, but as long as you keep your\
  \ wits about you, the residents of Hope County can rest assured knowing you\u2019\
  re their beacon of hope."
