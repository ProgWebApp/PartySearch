summary: "You\u2019ve fled your home, only to find yourself lost in space with a damaged\
  \ ship. Your only option is to beam down to the planet below and gather the resources\
  \ you need to repair your ship and set off to explore the vast, infinite universe\u2026\
  \n\nIn Starbound, you create your own story - there\u2019s no wrong way to play!\
  \ You may choose to save the universe from the forces that destroyed your home,\
  \ uncovering greater galactic mysteries in the process, or you may wish to forego\
  \ a heroic journey entirely in favor of colonizing uncharted planets."
