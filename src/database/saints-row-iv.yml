name: Saints Row IV
size: 10.0
summary: Unlike the first three games in the franchise, Saints Row 4 does not center
  around the main character defeating three rival gangs in order to take over a city.
  The Saints have now become a household name, and their leader has become the president
  of the Unites States. The antagonists in Saints Row 4 are an invading alien race
  known as the Zin. Most of the game takes place within a computer simulation of the
  city of Steelport controlled by the Zin, where the protagonist is attempting to
  free himself and his companions.
