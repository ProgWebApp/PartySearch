summary: 'Saints Row: The Third is the first Saints Row game that takes place in the
  city of Steelport. Much like the first two games, the story revolves around the
  Saints destroying and absorbing three rival gangs, taking over the city in the process.
  In Saints Row: The Third, these three gangs are the Morningstar, the Luchadores,
  and the Deckers. Unlike the first two games, these three gangs are all controlled
  by a criminal organization known as The Syndicate, which the saints must also deal
  with.'
