summary: "Ark: Survival Evolved takes on the survival genre with a unique blend of\
  \ emergent multiplayer cooperation and competition. Players awake naked and starving\
  \ on the beach of a mysterious island among a herd of other confused humans. On\
  \ ARK, they must then hunt, harvest, craft, research technology, and build shelters\
  \ to protect against scorching days, freezing nights, volatile weather systems,\
  \ dangerous wildlife, and potential enemies.\n\nUse cunning strategy and tactics\
  \ to tame and ride the many dinosaurs and other primeval creatures roaming the dynamic,\
  \ persistent ecosystems across land, sea, air, and even underground. Build your\
  \ character\u2019s strengths and gain items, skills, and pet creatures using in-depth\
  \ role-playing systems. Start a tribe with hundreds of other players to survive\
  \ and dominate competing tribes...and ultimately discover the ARK\u2019s true purpose."
